[-----------------------------------------------------------------------Rooms-----------------------------------------------------------------------]

	[Tenement F0]

The Tenement is a room. "You wake up to the drip of some cold water on your head. It's nothing unusual; the neighbors above have had a dilapidated floor for months now. It's amazing that it hasn't given in entirely.
The unforgiving drops continue to pound mericlessly against your head - drilling in the miserly state of your surroundings. Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight peek through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits."

[NOTE TO SELF]	[Make sure some of this is only repeated in the mornings or one time]
	
	[Alley F0]

The Alley is east of The Tenement. "You stumble from the darkness of the tenement into the gloomy alley. It's eerily quiet as this time of day, but in a few minutes you know the crowds will come pouring out from every household you can see. Perhaps you should move quickly to avoid the rush."

	[Front Gate F0]

The Front Gate is east of The Alley. "After about 15 minutes of walking, you finally show up at the factory front gate. Peeking through the clouds of smoke pouring from the chimneys, you can just barely tell that it's a sunny day.
You see all the other factory laborers slowly filing in, and sigh at the thought of having to start your 11 hour shift."

[NOTE TO SELF]	[MAKE SURE THIS IS TIME SENSITIVE]

	[Main Entrance F0]

The Main Entrance is south of Front Gate. "The hulking doors invite to swallow you in. You are hit by a gush of humid sweltry breeze - no, more than a breeze - it's the air you'll have to breathe now. 'There won’t be much to eat tonight,' You think sardonically. 

This isn't your entrance; this is for the factory elites - the owner, the overseer, and their friends. It's a privilege to use the main entrance. Wage workers like you have to go the long way through the worker's entrance."

	[Intake Desk F0]

The Intake Desk is south of Main Entrance

	[Spindle Room F0]
	
The Spindle Room is south of Intake Desk.

The Spindle Room Gossip is scenery in Spindle Room. The sound of Spindle Room Gossip is "Whisper whisper whisper".
	[Loading Dock F0]
	
The Loading Dock is east of Cotton Engines.
"You feel a light gust of outdoor air. Still, you feel just as caged in as you would in the Cotton Engines; the air is still full of chimney smoke, and the sounds are just as grating as ever.
It’s hard to see anything ahead of you with so many stacks of boxes in the way. You see Randy - a balding, overweight man - organizing them in some way you can’t understand."

	[Boiler Room F0]

The Boiler Room is south of Central Stairs.

	[Worker's Entrance F0]

The Worker's Entrance is west of Main Entrance. "As the workers file in, a young man yells at them to go faster. 'If any’un sees you messin’ around, you’ll be outuvva job!' You didn’t need any reminder of that."

	[Locker Rooms F0]
The Locker Rooms is south of Worker's Entrance and west of Cotton Engines.
"The first thing you notice as you walk into the locker rooms is the disgusting body odor radiating from every locker. You’re unsure how to describe the sensation of the smell hitting your body: perhaps it slammed into your body? Either way, you’re blinded momentarily by the horrid stench. After a few seconds that feel like an eternity, you regain your senses. You see the walls lined with tall metal lockers. A couple of benches are there on the ground for you to sit on while changing."

	[Cotton Engines F0]

The Cotton Engines is south of the Spindle Room. "As you work, the violent, periodic smashing of machinery forces itself into your head. You try to ignore it and focus on your cotton gin work, but every time you look at the machine, you can't help but picture what happened to Jones' wife. You shudder at the thought, and turn away from it in disgust for a bit, but then you think of the Overseer. The Overseer wouldn't like to see you distracted from your work."
[5 hours later, the machine whirring stops for lunch break. You only have 10 minutes.
You see your friend Winston in the other corner of the room. Being the (slightly) more well-off of you two, he has lunch for both of you."]

[NOTE TO SELF]	[TIME LUNCH AND SHIT, DONT REPEAT IT EVERY TIME]
	[Central Stairs B1-F1]

The Central Stairs is south of Cotton Engines. "You arrive at the stairwell. It’s dimly lit and handrail-free, with grated metal stairs that seem like they could barely support one person. You can't make out much above or below you, but you do hear the violent whirring of cotton gin machines coming from directly below your feet."

	[----------F1--------]
	
		[Finishing Room]
		
	The Finishing Room is above Central Stairs. "The most peaceful section of the building, the finishing room is a safe haven away from the rotten sounds and smells that pervade the rest of the factory. Large, plentiful windows let the sunlight in.
	
	You see three women silently knitting cotton clothes. None of them look like they want to be bothered."
	
	[----------B1----------]
	
		[Basement Stairs]
	The Basement Stairs is below Central Stairs. "Before you is a set of dusty, old, wooden stairs. The center of each stair has lost much of its color from use over the last however-many years. You look to the right and notice that the bare wooden framework of the cotton gin is visible. A single light bulb hangs from the ceiling to produce light.
On the bottom of the stairs is a heavy metal door, presumably leading to the rest of the basement. It looks as if there is a lock above the door knob. You think you would be able to open the door silently, but you’re not entirely sure."

		[Basement Door]
	The Basement Door is a locked closed door. The Basement Door is north of Basement Stairs and south of Main Basement.

		[Main Basement]
	The description of the Main Basement is "As soon as you enter, you notice that the air is not as stale as you would expect for a room that allegedly people had not been inside of for a long time. You can’t see very well, as the light is not on."

		[Hidden Basement Room]
	Hidden Basement Room is a room.
[-----------------------------------------------------------------------People-----------------------------------------------------------------------]

	[Jones]

Jones is a man in the Tenement. "Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did.
You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now."

	[Newspaper Boy]

The Boy is a man in the Alley. "You pass a boy, yelling about the latest issue of the Boston Globe. He holds up the paper to your face and says 'You want it, pal? Just 25 cents...' 
Your daily wage is about 50 cents. Is it really worth it?"

	[Winston]

Winston is a man in the Cotton Engines. Winston is carrying a lunch bag. "Your best friend, Winston, is working right next to you. He seems willing to talk."
		
	[Overseer]
	[Forces player back to work]
Overseer is a man in the Cotton Engines. "You see the Overseer. The Overseer is heavy and muscular, with a large white beard and eyes you can barely make out, what with all the bags and wrinkles covering them up. He’s somehow intimidating, despite the fact that it seems like his body could fall apart any second."

Overseer can be active or passive. Overseer is Active.

	[Jackie]
Jackie is a woman in Intake Desk. “You see Jackie, the company secretary, staring at the wall in silence as she sits at her reception desk. She glances at you quickly, taking on a suspicious expression, but then looks back, as if she has better things to do. Suddenly, she notices that you’re looking at the book on her desk. It’s hard to see what the title is, but instinctively, she grabs it and shoves it into the nearest drawer, locking it with a key.”
Every turn:
	if the player is in Intake Desk:
		say "Jackie, flustered, says 'What are you doing here!?' I have some strong words for that Overseer of yours.' and blows a small whistle.";

[NOTE TO SELF, REPEAT THIS ONCE]

	[Robin]
Robin is a woman in Spindle Room. “You see Robin, who is (like usual) gossiping with her neighbor. She’s trying to be discrete, but it’s hard not to hear her when she has to speak over the roar of the machines to be heard by anyone. You can’t make our every word, but maybe if you listen more carefully, you’ll get to hear something interesting…”

			'Cotton Gin Accident leaves Factory Worker Dead'
			
			The paper then explained what had happened to Jones' wife. She got too close to the machine, the paper said, and before she knew it, it sucked her in and tore her apart. Only some of her remains were found.
			
			You knew about this event well; it had happened in your own factory. But you hadn't seen the event take place, so it was interesting to see the details somewhere - especially when the company itself has been completely silent.
			
			You doubt that it'll break the silence any time soon, either.";
