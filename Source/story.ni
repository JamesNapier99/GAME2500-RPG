[-----------------------------------------------------------------------Rooms-----------------------------------------------------------------------]

	[Tenement F0]

The Tenement is a room. "You wake up to the drip of some cold water on your head. It's nothing unusual; the neighbors above have had a dilapidated floor for months now. It's amazing that it hasn't given in entirely.
The unforgiving drops continue to pound mericlessly against your head - drilling in the miserly state of your surroundings. Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight their way through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits."

[NOTE TO SELF]	[Make sure some of this is only repeated in the mornings or one time]
	
	[Alley F0]

The Alley is east of The Tenement. "You stumble from the darkness of the tenement into the gloomy alley. It's eerily quiet as this time of day, but in a few minutes you know the crowds will come pouring out from every household you can see. Perhaps you should move quickly to avoid the rush."

	[Front Gate F0]

The Front Gate is east of The Alley. "After about 15 minutes of walking, you finally show up at the factory front gate. Peeking through the clouds of smoke pouring from the chimneys, you can just barely tell that it's a sunny day.
You see all the other factory workers slowly filing in. 
Will you walk into the factory? As soon as you walk into the factory, you'll be starting your 11-hour shift."

[NOTE TO SELF]	[MAKE SURE THIS IS TIME SENSITIVE]

	[Main Entrance F0]

The Main Entrance is south of Front Gate. "The hulking doors invite to swallow you in. You are hit by a gush of humid sweltry breeze - no, not a breeze, it is the air you are to breathe now. It slowly cooks you in, ready to service you to some other. 'There won’t be much to eat,' You think sardonically. 
A small crowd of grim women shuffle around the Mecca of the puncher. It bites the slim slivers of paper."


	[Intake Desk F0]

The Intake Desk is south of Main Entrance

	[Spindle Room F0]

The Locker Rooms is south of Worker's Entrance and west of Cotton Engines.

	[Cotton Engines F0]

The Cotton Engines is south of the Spindle Room. "As you work, the violent, periodic smashing of machinery forces itself in your head. You try to ignore it and focus on your cotton gin work, but every time you look at the thing, you can't help but picture what happened to Jones' wife. You shudder at the thought, and turn away from the machine for a bit, but there your boss is, staring in your soul with a furious glare. You turn back to the machine and keep working."
[5 hours later, the machine whirring stops for lunch break. You only have 10 minutes.
You see your friend Winston in the other corner of the room. Being the (slightly) more well-off of you two, he has lunch for both of you."]

[NOTE TO SELF]	[TIME LUNCH AND SHIT, DONT REPEAT IT EVERY TIME]

	[----------B1----------]
	
		[Basement Stairs]
	The Basement Stairs is below Central Stairs. "Before you is a set of dusty, old, wooden stairs. The center of each stair has lost much of its color from use over the last however-many years. You look to the right and notice that the bare wooden framework of the cotton gin is visible. A single light bulb hangs from the ceiling to produce light.
On the bottom of the stairs is a heavy metal door, presumably leading to the rest of the basement. It looks as if there is a lock above the door knob. You think you would be able to open the door silently, but you’re not entirely sure."

		[Main Basement]
	The Main Basement is north of Basement Stairs. "As soon as you enter, you notice that the air is not as stale as you would expect for a room that allegedly people had not been inside of for a long time. You can’t see very well, as the light is not on."

		[Hidden Basement Room]
	Hidden Basement Room is a room.
[-----------------------------------------------------------------------People-----------------------------------------------------------------------]

	[Jones]

Jones is a man in the Tenement. "Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did.
You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now."

	[Newspaper Boy]

The Boy is a man in the Alley. "You pass a boy, yelling about the latest issue of the Boston Globe. He holds up the paper to your face and says 'You want it, pal? Just 25 cents...' 
Your daily wage is about 50 cents. Is it really worth it?"

	[Winston]

Winston is a man in the Cotton Engines. Winston is carrying a lunch bag.
		
	[Overseer]
	[Forces player back to work]
Overseer is a man in the Cotton Engines. "The Overseer is heavy and muscular, with a large white beard and eyes you can barely make out, what with all the bags and wrinkles covering them up. He’s somehow intimidating, despite the fact that it seems like his body could fall apart any second."

	[Jackie]
Jackie is a woman in Intake Desk. “You see Jackie, the company secretary, staring at the wall in silence as she sits at her reception desk. She glances at you quickly, taking on a suspicious expression, but then looks back, as if she has better things to do. Suddenly, she notices that you’re looking at the book on her desk. It’s hard to see what the title is, but instinctively, she grabs it and shoves it into the nearest drawer, locking it with a key.”
Every turn:
	if the player is in Intake Desk:
		say "Jackie, flustered, says 'What are you doing here!?' I have some strong words for that Overseer of yours.' and blows a small whistle.";
		move the Overseer to Intake Desk;
		say "The Overseer stalks into the room, clearly angry that he heard the whistle."

[NOTE TO SELF, REPEAT THIS ONCE]

	[Robin]
Robin is a woman in Spindle Room. “You see Robin, who is (like usual) gossiping with her neighbor. She’s trying to be discrete, but it’s hard not to hear her when she has to speak over the roar of the machines to be heard by anyone. You can’t make our every word, but maybe if you listen more carefully, you’ll get to hear something interesting…”

[------------------------------------------------------------------------Things-----------------------------------------------------------------------]
													[----------Sound----------]
													
A thing has some text called sound. The sound of a thing is usually "silence". 

The report listening rule is not listed in the report listening to rules. 

Carry out listening to something: 
	say "From [the noun] you hear [the sound of the noun]." 

Instead of listening to a room: 
	if an audible thing can be touched by the player, say "You hear [the list of audible things which can be touched by the player]."; 
	otherwise say "Nothing of note.";

Definition: a thing is audible if the sound of it is not "silence". 

Before printing the name of something audible while listening to a room: 
	say "[sound] from the ";
													[---------------------------]
													
The newspaper, paper is a thing. The newspaper, paper is carried by the Boy. 

instead of examining a thing:
	if the noun is newspaper or the noun is paper:
		if the Boy is carrying the newspaper:
			say "The boy pulls the newspaper out of your face, saying 'Oi, you can't look before ya buy!'";
		otherwise:
			 say "The paper is dated October 4, 1872. Seems to be a high end newspaper, because you can't understand many of the words. There is, however, one section that catches your eye.
			
			'Cotton Gin Accident leaves Factory Worker Dead'
			
			The paper then explained what had happened to Jones' wife. She got too close to the machine, the paper said, and before she knew it, it sucked her in and tore her apart. Only some of her remains were found.
			
			You knew about this event well; it had happened in your own factory. But you hadn't seen the event take place, so it was interesting to see the details somewhere - especially when the company itself has been completely silent.
			
			You doubt that it'll break the silence any time soon, either.";
