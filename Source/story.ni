The NPC room is a room.

A Factory Room is a kind of room. 
	[Tenement F0]


The Tenement is a room. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM] 
You wake up to a sear of cold dripping on your head.
It's just water. 
Nothing unusual; the neighbors above have had a dilapidated floor for months now. It's amazing that it hasn't given in entirely.

The unforgiving drops continue to pound mericlessly against your head - drilling into you the miserly state of your surroundings. Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe the other tenants in your room. 
Like shadows, being just as thin and sulken, they all curl, and clutch to themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else.

Dim rays of grimly colored sunlight blaze through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. Work awaits.

To the east is the Alley.
[otherwise]
You're back home. Your bed is right there, and you feel a strong urge to sleep, but at the same time you can't stop thinking about the factory.

To the east is the Alley.
".
	
	[Alley F0]
The Alley is east of The Tenement. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
You stumble from the darkness of the tenement into the gloomy alley. It's eerily quiet as this time of day, but in a few minutes you know the crowds will come pouring out from every household you can see. Perhaps you should move quickly to avoid the rush.

To the west is the Tenement. To the east is the Front Gate
[otherwise]
You walk stealthily through the alley, hoping that nobody will detect you and think you're a thief. (Who else is going to be walking here at this time of night?) It's strangely peaceful, with the full moon directly overhead.

To the west is the Tenement. To the east is the Front Gate".

	[Front Gate F0]

The Front Gate is east of The Alley. "[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
After about 15 minutes of walking through a waking town, you have arrived at the factory front gate. Snakes of smoke pour from the high chimneys and hide the sun behind a screen of noxious black. The world lies in a dreamish haze.
You see all the other factory laborers slowly filing in, and sigh at the thought of having to start your 11 hour shift.

To the west is the Alley. To the south is the Main Entrance.
[otherwise]
It's a rare sight to see the factory completely free of noxious smoke. You almost start feeling pleasant, but then you hear the echo of a loud crash. It seems like it came inside the factory. Suddenly, your mind races, as infinite fears - rational and irrational - cross your mind. Is the Overseer still here? Is someone getting killed? Are the machines acting up? You wonder if it's safe to be here at this hour.

To the west is the Alley. To the south is the Main Entrance".

	[Main Entrance F0]


The Main Entrance is a Factory Room. The Main Entrance is south of Front Gate. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
The hulking doors invite to swallow you in. You are hit by a gush of humid sweltry breeze - no, more than a breeze - it's the air you'll have to breathe now. 'There won’t be much to eat tonight,' You think sardonically.
This isn't your entrance; this is for the factory elites - the owner, the overseer, and their friends. It's a privilege to use the main entrance. Wage workers like you have to go the long way through the worker's entrance.

To the north is the Front Gate. To the south is the Intake Desk. To the west is the Worker's Entrance.
[otherwise]
The Main Factory Door is wide open. You're surprised at first, but you recall that the Overseer has been forgetful about these kinds of things. You assume that he just forgot to close it.

To the north is the Front Gate. To the south is the Intake Desk. To the west is the Worker's Entrance.".

	[Intake Desk F0]

The Intake Desk is a Factory Room. The Intake Desk is south of Main Entrance. "Crafted from luxurious black wood, the intake desks stand in stark contrast from the rest of the factory. No one ever mans it, but it still makes you feel watched. 

To the north is the Main Entrance. To the south is the Spindle Room".

	[Spindle Room F0]
	
The Spindle Room is south of Intake Desk. "You sneak into the Spindle Room. Machines stretch the length and width of the factory creating a gridlike labyrith of rust and steel...It's hard to see an end to the rows of contraptions. 

To the north is the Intake Desk. To the south is the Cotton Engines.

[If the time of day is after 6 PM or the time of day is before 5:44 AM]The room is silent.".

The Spindle Room Gossip is scenery in Spindle Room. The sound of Spindle Room Gossip is "[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
conversation between Robin and her partner:
'...Who even ordered her down there in the first place? It doesn't make sense! There's no reason management would care to have her outside of the Spindle Room!'
Her partner's response: 'Rumor has it that Jackie wanted her down there. Only God knows why, though...' You're fascinated, but you should always take it with a grain of salt when it comes[otherwise]silence".

	[Loading Dock F0]
	
The Loading Dock is east of Cotton Engines. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
You feel a light gust of outdoor air. Still, you feel just as caged in as you would in the Cotton Engines; the air is still full of chimney smoke, and the sounds are just as grating as ever.
It’s hard to see anything ahead of you with so many stacks of boxes in the way. You see Randy - a balding, overweight man carrying a candle (strange that he'd do something like that in broad daylight). He organizes the boxes in some way you can’t understand, then walks behind the boxes again, out of sight.

To the west is the Cotton Engines.
[else if the candle is in the Loading Dock]

The heat is nearly unbearable. Steam dances in and out from a mosaic of pipes without warning, bathing you in burning condensation

To the north is the Central Stairs.
[otherwise if insanity <= 40]
The steaming heat of the boiler room has been replaced by a slight - yet still uncomfortable - warmth. As you inspect the room, you see that condensed steam has left marks on the machines that look strangely like letters.

The Worker's Entrance is a Factory Room. The Worker's Entrance is west of Main Entrance. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
The grim workers shuffle around the Mecca of the puncher. It bites savagely into the slim slivers of paper slipped into the cracked rusted box. You join the slow-moving hoard and punch in your strip of paper. Click.

To the east is the Main Entrance. To the south is the Locker Rooms.

You feel an uncomfortably cold gust of wind cross your body as you approach the Worker's Entrance.

	[Locker Rooms F0]
The Locker Rooms is a Factory Room. The Locker Rooms is south of Worker's Entrance and west of Cotton Engines."
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
The first thing you notice as you walk into the locker rooms is the disgusting body odor radiating from every locker. You’re unsure how to describe the sensation of the smell hitting your body: perhaps it slammed into your body? Either way, you’re blinded momentarily by the horrid stench. After a few seconds that feel like an eternity, you regain your senses. A couple of benches are there on the ground for you to sit on while changing. You see the walls lined with tall metal lockers, both closed and (mysteriously) open.

To the north is the Worker's Entrance. To the east is the Cotton Engines.
[otherwise]
The smell of the locker room is only slightly less horrendous at night - but the added darkness makes that smell all your mind can process. You see the walls lined with tall metal lockers. A couple of benches are there on the ground for you to sit on.

To the north is the Worker's Entrance. To the east is the Cotton Engines.".

The Locker Rooms contains the metal lockers. The metal lockers is scenery.

The Locker Rooms contains a broken locker. In the broken locker is the Mysterious Key. The broken locker is closed and openable. The broken locker is scenery.

The Mysterious key is an object. "This strangely designed key seems to warp and shift it's non-euclidean geometry. It brings on a headache if looked at too closely.".

	[Cotton Engines F0]
The Cotton Engines is a Factory Room. The Cotton Engines is south of the Spindle Room. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
As you work, the violent, periodic smashing of machinery forces itself into your head. You try to ignore it and focus on your cotton gin work, but every time you look at the machine, you can't help but picture what happened to Jones' wife. You shudder at the thought, and turn away from it in disgust for a bit, but then you think of the Overseer. The Overseer wouldn't like to see you distracted from your work.

To the north is the Spindle Room. To the east is the Loading Dock. To the south is the Central Stairs. To the west is the Locker Rooms.
[otherwise]
It's so dark inside the Cotton Engines that you almost stab yourself on the harsher end of a machine. At this point, you start to hear a strange periodic whirring, but it's hard to tell where it is, or what it could be coming from.

The Central Stairs is a Factory Room. The Central Stairs is south of Cotton Engines.  "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
You arrive at the stairwell. It’s dimly lit and handrail-free, with grated metal stairs that seem like they could barely support one person. You can't make out much above or below you, but you do hear the violent whirring of cotton gin machines coming from directly below your feet.

To the north is the Cotton Engines. To the south is the Boiler Room. Up is the Finishing Room. Down is the Basement Stairs.
[otherwise if insanity <= 80]
You remember where you are just in time to avoid losing your sense of direction and falling down the staircase. That whirring you heard in the Cotton Engines is intensifying. Getting louder. More violent. More painful. It's starting to grind on your senses. Where is it?

[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
The most peaceful section of the building, the finishing room is a safe haven away from the rotten sounds and smells that pervade the rest of the factory. Large, plentiful windows let the sunlight in.
You see three women whispering to each other as they knit cotton clothes. None of them look like they want to be bothered. Perhaps this is something you could listen in on?

	[Basement Stairs]
The Basement Stairs is below Central Stairs. "
[If the time of day is before 6 PM and the time of day is after 5:44 AM]
Before you is a set of dusty, old, wooden stairs. The center of each stair has lost much of its color from use over the last however-many years. You look to the right and notice that the bare wooden framework of the cotton gin is visible. A single light bulb hangs from the ceiling to produce light.
On the bottom of the stairs is a heavy metal door, presumably leading to the rest of the basement. It looks as if there is a lock above the door knob. You think you would be able to open the door silently, but you’re not entirely sure.

West is the Basement Door. Up is the Central Stairs.
[otherwise]
You guide yourself carefully down each individual step, as the whirring gets louder. Louder. Louder. You can hardly take it. You're internally screaming at yourself to run, to go higher and seek shelter from whatever's uttering this sound. But you continue anyway, torturing yourself, not knowing why.

	[Main Basement]
Main Basement is a room. "As soon as you enter, you notice that the air is not as stale as you would expect for a room that allegedly people had not been inside of for a long time. [If the player is carrying a candle] You illuminate the room with your candle. Surrounding you is a large open room, mostly barren. The walls are completely made of brick. Both the floor and ceiling seem to be made out of wood, with wooden support beams holding the ceiling. [otherwise] You have no hope of seeing anything in here until you bring some kind of light source.

	[Hidden Basement Room]
Machine Room is a room. "
You walk into a narrow corridor, and walk towards a faint light on the other side. As you approach, you start to notice the smell of blood. Several more steps and you smell rotting flesh. Eventually, you manage to get to the room where the light comes from, and what you see before you horrifies you to your very core.
	
You see the Machine. 
A massive metal structure - organism? - in the middle of a large room. It moves, breathes, like it's human, but its contorted metal parts make its humanlike features feel unreal - so disturbing and unnatural that you simply can't look at it straight. It's almost like it has control over your head, jerking it away every time you turn your head toward its direction. 
In some kind of vain attempt at a human voice, the machine squeaks and roars with mad energy. You don't understand. You can't possibly understand - until suddenly, it's as if the machine's soul becomes infused with yours, and you hear everything.
'WOMAN ---- IS ---- DEAD
WOMAN ---- PARTS ---- INSIDE ---- ME
WOMAN ---- PARTS ---- MAKE ---- ME ---- MORE ---- HUMAN
YOU ---- WILL ---- MAKE ---- ME ---- HUMAN ---- TOO
