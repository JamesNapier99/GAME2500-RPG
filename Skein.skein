You hurry back to the cotton engines.&#x000A;&#x000A;Cotton Engines&#x000A;As you work, the violent, periodic smashing of machinery forces itself into your head. You try to ignore it and focus on your cotton gin work, but every time you look at the machine, you can't help but picture what happened to Jones" wife. You shudder at the thought, and turn away from it in disgust for a bit, but then you think of the Overseer. The Overseer wouldn't like to see you distracted from your work.&#x000A;&#x000A;Your best friend, Winston, is working right next to you. He seems willing to talk.&#x000A;&#x000A;Well that was rude.

You're unsure how to describe the sensation of the smell hitting your body: perhaps it slammed into your body? Either way, you're blinded momentarily by the horrid stench. After a few seconds that feel like an eternity, you regain your senses. You see the walls lined with tall metal lockers. A couple of benches are there on the ground for you to sit on while changing.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see some closed lockers lined up across the wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Interestingly, alongside the closed lockers are some unaccompanied open ones.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see lone locker and three benches here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's amazing that it hasn't given in entirely. The unforgiving drops continue to pound mericlessly against your head - drilling in the miserly state of your surroundings. Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight peek through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did. You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's amazing that it hasn't given in entirely. The unforgiving drops continue to pound mericlessly against your head - drilling in the miserly state of your surroundings. Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight peek through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did. You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight peek through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did. You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Tenement&#x000A;You wake up to the drip of some cold water on your head. It's nothing unusual; the neighbors above have had a dilapidated floor for months now. It's amazing that it hasn't given in entirely. The unforgiving drops continue to pound mericlessly against your head - drilling in the miserly state of your surroundings. Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight peek through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did. You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's eerily quiet as this time of day, but in a few minutes you know the crowds will come pouring out from every household you can see. Perhaps you should move quickly to avoid the rush.&#x000A;&#x000A;You pass a boy, yelling about the latest issue of the Boston Globe. He holds up the paper to your face and says "You want it, pal? Just 25 cents..." Your daily wage is about 50 cents. Is it really worth it?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You're unsure how to describe the sensation of the smell hitting your body: perhaps it slammed into your body? Either way, you're blinded momentarily by the horrid stench. After a few seconds that feel like an eternity, you regain your senses. You see the walls lined with tall metal lockers. A couple of benches are there on the ground for you to sit on while changing.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see three benches here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Swerving from the next oncoming drip, you adjust yourself, and observe other tenants in your room. Each of them are shells:  diminished beings curling, clutching themselves as if to hold on to the meager remains of their life-force in their cagey bodies. Clothes are a laugh at this point, looking more like throwaway rags than anything else. The dim rays of sunlight peek through the musty room, announcing the break of dawn. You force yourself out of bed. Work awaits.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jones is the only other tenant that appears to be awake. It's only reasonable - how could he sleep? Nobody - not if they went through what he did. You feel the urge to approach him, but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do right now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
